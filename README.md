### This includes:
* vim
* zsh

You'll want to have [GNU stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow) installed,
which you can do by running `brew install stow` if you have
[homebrew](http://brew.sh) installed (which you should).

Then, just run the `bin/stow` bash script included in this repo, and you should be 
golden.
