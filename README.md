### This includes:
* vim
* zsh

You'll want to have [GNU stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow) installed,
which you can do by running `brew install stow` if you have
[homebrew](http://brew.sh) installed (which you should).

Then, just run `bin/stow <target directory>`, and you should be 
golden.
